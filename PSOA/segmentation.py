           This function computes the observation windows based on the geometry

                              optlist, et)

            Inputs:
              > obsinfo:  struct containing observer and target information,
                          including spacecraft and target SPICE ID names
              > obtlist:  List of structs that contain the information about the
                          observable targets and includes the following fields:
                  # obs:          string SPICE name of the observer body (spacecraft)
                  # inst:         string SPICE name of the instrument
                  # target:       string SPICE name of the body target
                  # campaign:     string that defines the type of campaign:
                      1. 'global': global (large) ROI (future work)
                      2. 'local':  local (small) ROI
                      3. 'single': single point
                  # vertices:    coordinates that bound the observable target.
                                  If it is a single campaign, the latitudinal
                                  coordinates of the observable point are provided.
                                  In the case of both types of ROI, this is a matrix
                                  containing the vertices of the polygon. The vertex
                                  points are expressed in 2D, in latitudinal
                                  coordinates [ยบ]
                  # rgn_name:     string name of the observable target

                                  queries that apply to the defined observable target.
                                  For instance: qkeys = {'emnang', 'ill', 'dist'};
              > et:       time epoch in TDB seconds past J2000 epoch. It can be
                          either a single point in time or a discretized vector of
                          different time values
